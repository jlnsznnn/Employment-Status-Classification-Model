The target variable, **New Employment Criteria**, categorizes individuals into three groups: Employed, Unemployed, and Not in the Labor Force. Several features, including age, sex, education level, occupation, and work history, are considered to determine their relationship with employment status.\n",

By evaluating the performance of these models, we aim to identify the most effective approach for employment prediction, which could aid in labor policy formulation and workforce development initiatives."
