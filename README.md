# Employment-Status-Classification-Model

This project uses April 2016 Labor Force Survey (LFS) data to analyze employment trends by building a classification model that predicts employment status (Employed, Unemployed, or Not in the Labor Force) using demographic and socio-economic features. It compares Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Naïve Bayes.
